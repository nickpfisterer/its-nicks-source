Wishing you could have your very own BB-8 droid from Star Wars: The Force Awakens? Christian Poulsen over at Makezine has posted [a tutorial](http://makezine.com/projects/make-this-mini-star-wars-bb-8-ball-droid-with-a-hacked-sphero/) on how to make your own miniature version of BB-8. It actually works, and the effect looks pretty damn close to the real thing.
