If you've heard about the upcoming Windows 10, you probably know that Microsoft is working on an entirely new web browser code-named Project Spartan. Today, Microsoft revealed the production name for the browser: [Meet Microsoft Edge](http://www.theverge.com/2015/4/29/8511169/microsoft-edge-official-name-internet-explorer-upgrade).

I've been using the Windows 10 Technical Preview for about a month. I've played with Project Spartan a few times. It's not ready for daily use in its current state, but there are some cool ideas being explored. I'm excited to see what modern web features it supports when Windows 10 launches. With Windows 10 launching for free - a first for Microsoft - it will be particularly interesting to see how Internet Explorer usage is affected.
