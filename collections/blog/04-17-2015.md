Renowned CSS expert Eric Meyer was a guest this week on [ShopTalk Show](http://shoptalkshow.com/episodes/161-with-eric-meyer/), my favorite web design podcast. It was easily one of the most engaging podcasts I've listened to in recent years. Eric talks about the emotional journey from losing his daughter to giving a talk on a subject that clearly not enough of us think about: designing for crisis. If you listen to one podcast this weekend, make it this one.
